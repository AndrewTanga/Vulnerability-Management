# Vulnerability-Management(In Progress)

## Introduction

In this project:
1. Azure environment preparatory: 
   • Prepared the Azure environment by configuring networking settings, creating resource groups, and setting up access controls.
2. Deployed Vulnerability Management Scanner: 
   • Deployed a vulnerability management scanner compatible with Azure and ensured its proper configuration within the environment.
3. Created Client Virtual Machine and Made it Vulnerable: 
   • Created a client virtual machine and made it vulnerable by installing three outdated applications.
4. Performed Unauthenticated Scan: 
   • Conducted an unauthenticated scan on the virtual machine to identify vulnerabilities without providing any credentials.
5. Made Configurations for Authenticated Scans (Within VM): 
   • Configured the virtual machine to enable authenticated scans by setting up user accounts, permissions, and necessary services.
6. Made Configurations for Authenticated Scans (OpenVAS): 
   • Configured OpenVAS to perform authenticated scans by providing necessary authentication credentials and configuring scan settings.
7. Performed Authenticated Scan against Vulnerable Windows VM: 
   • Conducted an authenticated scan against the vulnerable Windows VM using the configured scanner to accurately identify vulnerabilities.
8. Remediated Vulnerabilities: 
   • Remedied identified vulnerabilities by applying patches, disabling unnecessary services, and updating configurations on the virtual machine.
9. Verified Remediations: 
   • Verified the effectiveness of remediation actions by rescanning the virtual machine and ensuring that previously identified vulnerabilities have been addressed.
10. Compiled a List of Remedied Vulnerabilities: 
   • Documented all remedied vulnerabilities for future reference and reporting purposes, ensuring that the system is now more secure.



## Configured OpenVAS to Perform First Unauthenticated Scan against Vulnerable VM
 [Create a new target from the host - Create a new task - Start the scan] 
![Unauthenticated](https://github.com/AndrewTanga/Vulnerability-Management/assets/93886645/82d30626-6264-49e2-872f-7d32b09c1399)
An unauthenticated scan revealed a result of 32 vulnerabilities.

## Configured settings for Credentialed Scans within the VM and OpenVAS, and executed a Credentialed Scan against the Vulnerable Windows VM.
[VM: Disable Windows Firewall - Disable User Account Control - Enable Remote Registry - Set Registry Key; OpenVAS: Create new credential - clone task - edit target - start scan]
 ![Credentialed](https://github.com/AndrewTanga/Vulnerability-Management/assets/93886645/e814fa61-63f7-4c4e-9129-826a530e82a7)
After conducting a credentialed scan, a total of 131 vulnerabilities were identified. 


## Remediate Vulnerabilities by uninstalling/patching outdated/unused programs
[Uninstall outdated softwares (in this case Adobe Reader, VLC Player, and Firefox)]
![Credentialed no vuln app](https://github.com/AndrewTanga/Vulnerability-Management/assets/93886645/5d241e55-cdd2-4dd5-974b-2df3cdec767b)
After removing the vulnerable applications, a subsequent scan revealed a total of 50 vulnerabilities, representing a reduction of 81 vulnerabilities or a decrease of 38% compared to the initial assessment.

## List of remedied vulnerabilities
• VLS media player 1.1.7
• Mozila Firefox (x64 en-US)
• Adobe Reader X
